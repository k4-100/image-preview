# IMPORTANT

1. samples are stored in samples/ directory (feel free to use some other images if you wish to)
2. Firefox should provide the best experience (there is a bunch of bugs I didn't get a chance to get to), but obviously I acknowledge most browsers are chromium based, so they work well to
3. I use differents e-mails for my contact and for my git.
   In case of that or any other question please feel free to ask.
